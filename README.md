Task One

*I chose to use .netcore.__
Since its a basic CRUD was implemented, the basic CRUD functionality and the little advanced MongoDb features implemented__
were combined into one repository.__
A local installation of MongoDb was used and no replica sets were created, so transactions were show cased here.__
Aggregation pipeline advanced feature was show cased to an extent in this task.__*
