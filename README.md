Task One

*I chose to use .netcore. 
Since its a basic CRUD was implemented, the basic CRUD functionality and the little advanced MongoDb features implemented 
were combined into one repository. 
A local installation of MongoDb was used and no replica sets were created, so transactions were show cased here. 
Aggregation pipeline advanced feature was show cased to an extent in this task. *
