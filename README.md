Task One

I chose to use .netcore. <br/>
Since its a basic CRUD that was implemented, the basic CRUD functionality and the little advanced MongoDb features implemented were combined into one repository. <br/><br/>
A local installation of MongoDb was used and no replica sets were created, so transactions were not showcased here. <br/><br/>
Aggregation pipeline advanced features was showcased to an extent in this task. <br/><br/>
Also exception handling wasn't really focused on since its a basic CRUD showcase.
