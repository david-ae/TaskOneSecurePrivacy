Task One

*I chose to use .netcore. <br/>
Since its a basic CRUD was implemented, the basic CRUD functionality and the little advanced MongoDb features implemented <br/><br/>
were combined into one repository. <br/><br/>
A local installation of MongoDb was used and no replica sets were created, so transactions were show cased here. <br/><br/>
Aggregation pipeline advanced feature was show cased to an extent in this task.*
